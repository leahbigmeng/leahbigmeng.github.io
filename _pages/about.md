Hi, I’m Shuomeng (Leah) Zhang (Chinese: 张硕萌), a passionate Digital Product Designer dedicated to crafting user-centered and impactful solutions. I recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, earning a First-Class [MSc in Design Informatics](assets/pdf/grad_cert.pdf) with a Class Prize for outstanding performance.

Prior to this, I completed a BEng in Industrial Design and a Bachelor’s in Management in China, which provided me with a strong foundation in design thinking and business acumen. My experience spans UI/UX design, with a focus on creating meaningful digital experiences that enhance usability and delight users.

I’m excited to continue my journey as a designer, turning innovative ideas into intuitive digital products that make a difference.
