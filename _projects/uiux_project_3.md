In this digital age, mobile payments and online transactions have almost replaced the traditional use of physical currency in daily life. Learning to interact with money through a piggy bank has become a distant memory. Can children of the new era, who only see numbers on a screen, truly understand the value of money? How can we cultivate children's saving habits and instill sound spending concepts? How should parents guide their children in learning basic financial knowledge and money management skills?

To address these challenges and gaps, I designed a parent-child app called E-Piggy while studying Figma and related UI/UX knowledge. Through collaboration and edutainment, the app conveys financial knowledge, helps parents monitor their children's money usage, and enables children to better adapt to the digital financial market while establishing a healthy perspective on money.

This was a 5-week personal project aimed at mastering the app design process and improving proficiency in tools like Figma.
