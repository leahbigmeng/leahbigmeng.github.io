With the rise of affluent lifestyles and the single economy in Asia, the demand for pet cats has grown significantly. Preferences for specific breeds, pedigrees, and even unique genetic mutations have given rise to unethical breeding practices, known as the "backyard cat" industry in China. To maximize profits, unscrupulous breeders often pair cats unfit for reproduction or engage in inbreeding, resulting in cats prone to congenital genetic diseases and unpredictable mutations. This leads to a high rate of abandonment, exacerbating the challenge of managing the growing population of stray cats in cities.

Although the "Adopt, Don't Shop" initiative has gained traction, the adoption process remains complex and heavily reliant on the goodwill and efforts of volunteers, which lacks efficiency and sustainability for long-term impact.

Therefore, I aim to design a systemic service that connects various societal forces to make cat rescue and adoption a sustainable and normalized lifestyle. This approach not only addresses the challenges of managing and rescuing stray cats but also curbs unethical breeding practices. Additionally, it helps caring individuals seeking pets to find cats that suit their needs.

This project focuses on analyzing the current situation and stakeholders. By employing methods like research, Business Canvas, and Service Blueprint, I propose design concepts to address these issues.
