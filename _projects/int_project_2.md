**Abstract**
Blindness within contemporary society prevents people from seeing the broader implications of their interventions and ways of being. What medium defines peopleâ€™s illness, disability, and identity? When you realize through a certain medium that your objective existence conflicts with social norms at present, what is your initial reaction? Is it to adjust yourself to fit into it, or to be yourself and change it?

YouSelf is an audio-visual interactive installation that invites participants to contemplate the conflict of their body to the standardized social framework. Taking data of an identity-related questionnaire, visualize them as a physical door, which represents the cultural value framework of the past. By creating an experience of walking through the data, visitors could either modify their body or not as the shape of the framework to pass through. The physical interaction of individuals will construct a new visual framework on the projected screen, symbolizing prospective trajectories, and subsequently influencing the evolution of their envisioned social identity constructs.
