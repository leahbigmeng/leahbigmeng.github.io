In life, many individuals dedicate themselves silently and are often overlookedâ€”caregivers for chronic illness patients are a prime example. They frequently bear the emotional and physical burdens of others, leaving their own physical and mental health significantly worse off than the average person. But what are the real underlying reasons for this? Beyond a robust caregiving system and social welfare support, what other ways can we improve caregivers' quality of life and reduce their psychological burden?

This was my undergraduate graduation project. From detailed field research and interviews to design development, I aimed to raise societal awareness through my research and help more people through my design solutions.
