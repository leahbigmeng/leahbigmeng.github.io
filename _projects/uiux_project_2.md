The Design Exhibition is an annual highlight at Tianjin University. Due to the pandemic, a website was introduced in 2021 to showcase students' outstanding designs and curatorial concepts to those unable to attend the physical exhibition. The theme of this year's exhibition was ["Light to Lights"](http://idesign.tju.edu.cn/exhibitions2021/index/index.html). I participated in various aspects of the curatorial process, including theme development, visual guidelines, website design and development. This effort provided an excellent experience for both participants and viewers.

This was my first UIUX project to complete both development and functionality implementation. It involved collaboration with multiple stakeholders, including university representatives, curators, exhibitors, and engineers.

The first step was establishing the visual identity for this hybrid online-offline exhibition. Collaborating closely with the offline curation team, we jointly developed the exhibition theme and defined the basic visual guidelines to ensure consistency and facilitate website planning and design.

During the initial research phase, we analyzed over 20 exhibition-related websites, studying their **information architecture**, **user flow**, **design**, and **interactions**. Based on the findings, and considering the exhibition theme, content, as well as the needs of both exhibitors and visitors, we constructed our own information architecture for the website.

    <div class="col-sm mt-2 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/2-3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>

For the home page design, we implemented a horizontal scrolling layout. After exploring various layouts and designs, we finalized a high-fidelity prototype. Throughout the design process, we strictly adhered to alignment principles and effectively utilized key visual elements.

Additionally, I established the exhibit database, defined content submission guidelines and requirements, managed the information entry for 84 online exhibits and 126 exhibitors, assigned unique IDs to each exhibit, and applied watermarks to over 500 images and videos.

    Over nearly two months of work, I served as the primary designer and utilized Gantt charts for project management, facilitating effective coordination and organization.
